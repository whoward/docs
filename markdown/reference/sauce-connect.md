Sauce Connect is a secure tunneling app which allows you to execute tests securely when testing behind firewalls via a secure connection between Sauce Labs’ client cloud and your environment.

##  When should I use Sauce Connect?

You should use Sauce Connect whenever you’re testing an app behind a firewall. Sauce Connect is **not** required to execute scripts on Sauce.

You can also use Sauce Connect:

- as an alternative to whitelisting
- as a means of filtering traffic in your records (e.g. for Google Analytics)
- as a means of monitoring network traffic
- as a way to stabilize network connections (detecting/re-sending dropped packets)

##  Getting started

1. Get Sauce Connect v4:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://saucelabs.com/downloads/sc-latest-osx.zip"><i class="fa fa-apple"></i> Download Sauce Connect for OS X</a><br>

</li>
</ul>
2. Unzip (or untar).  
3. Open a command prompt.
4. Make sure port 443 can be opened for outbound connections (or, configure Sauce Connect with a proxy that can reach saucelabs.com, using the `--proxy` or `--pac` [command line options][1]). 
5. Go to the install directory and start sc:

```bash
bin/sc -u sauceUsername -k sauceAccessKey
```

6. When you see "connected", you are ready to go! 
7. Read our take on security: [Security best practices][2]

##  How is Sauce Connect secured?

Though starting up a tunnel using Sauce Connect may take a few seconds, our tunneling method allows for the highest possible security. We spin up a secure tunnel sandbox environment for each tunnel connection in order to provide greater tunnel security and isolation from other customers.

Data transmitted by Sauce Connect is encrypted through industry-standard TLS, using the AES-256 cipher. Sauce Connect also uses a caching web proxy to minimize data transfer. To read more about security on Sauce, read our [security white paper][5].

Within your infrastructure, Sauce Connect needs access to the application under test, but can be firewalled from the rest of your internal network. We recommend running Sauce Connect in a firewall DMZ, on a dedicated machine, and setting up firewall rules to restrict access from that DMZ to your internal network.

##  Setup process

During startup, Sauce Connect issues a series of HTTPS requests to the Sauce Labs REST API. These are outbound connections to saucelabs.com on port 443. Using the REST API, Sauce Connect checks for updates and other running Sauce Connect sessions, and ultimately launches a remote tunnel endpoint VM. Once the VM is started, a tunnel connection is established to a makiXXXXX.miso.saucelabs.com address on port 443, and all traffic between Sauce Labs and Sauce Connect is then multiplexed over this single encrypted TLS connection.

![SetupProcess](/images/reference/sauce-connect/sc-setup-process.png)

1. Sauce Connect makes HTTPS REST API calls to saucelabs.com:443 using the username and access key provided when starting Sauce Connect.
2. Sauce Labs creates a dedicated virtual machine which will serve as the endpoint of the tunnel connection created by Sauce Connect.
3. Sauce Labs responds with the unique ID of the virtual machine created up in step 2.
4. Sauce Connect establishes a TLS connection directly to the dedicated virtual machine created in step 2. (makiXXXXX.miso.saucelabs.com).
5. All test traffic is multiplexed over the tunnel connection established in step 4.

##  Teardown process

Once Sauce Connect is asked terminated (typically via ctrl-c), a call will be made from Sauce Connect to the REST API with instructions to terminate the tunnel VM. Sauce Connect will continue to poll the REST API until the tunnel VM has been halted and deleted.

##  System requirements

These vary depending on the number of parallel tests you plan to run. Here are some samples based on simultaneous test volume:

# Parallel Ram Processor

| Parallel Tests      | Ram  | Processor |
| -------------       | :-------------: | :-------------: |
| 10 tests (Use your dev machine)  | 4gb | 4GHz |
| 100 tests<br/>+ use a dedicated Connect server<br/>+ ulimit -n 8192| 8gb  | 4GHz |

For increased reliability and security, use a dedicated server.

##  Advanced configuration

The `sc` command line program accepts the following parameters:



    Usage: ./sc

                                    Requests whose host matches one of
                                    these will be relayed directly
                                    through the internet, instead of
                                    through the tunnel.

                                    reaching Connect on this port will
                                    be relayed to Sauce Labs securely
                                    and reliably through Connect's

##  Managing multiple tunnels

In its default mode of execution, one Connect instance will suffice all your needs and will require no efforts to make cloud browsers driven by your tests navigate through the tunnel.

Just start Connect, all traffic from jobs under the same account will use it transparently. Stop that tunnel, all jobs will stop to do so and attempt to find your web servers through the open internet.

Using identified tunnels, you can start multiple instances of Connect that will not collide with each other and will not make your tests' traffic transparently tunnel through.

This allows you to test different localhost servers or access different networks from different tests (a common requirement when running tests on TravisCI.)

To use this feature, simply start Sauce Connect using the --tunnel-identifier flag (or -i) and provide your own unique identifier string. Once the tunnel is up and running, any tests that you want going through this tunnel will need to provide the correct identifier using the tunnel-identifier desired capability.

Please note that in order to run multiple Sauce Connect instances on the same machine, it's necessary to provide additional flags to configure independent log files, pid files, and ports for each instant. Here's an example of how to configure all of these settings for a second instance:


```bash
sc --pidfile /tmp/sc2.pid --logfile /tmp/sc2.log --scproxy-port 29999 --se-port 4446 -i my-tun2
```

##  Can I reuse a tunnel between multiple accounts?

Tunnels started by an account can be reused by its sub-accounts. To reuse a tunnel, start Sauce Connect with the special --shared-tunnel parameter from the main account in your account tree. For example:

```bash
sc --shared-tunnel parentAccount parentAccountsAccessKey
```
Once the tunnel is running, provide the special "parent-tunnel" desired capability on a per-job basis. The value of this capability should be the username of the parent account that owns the shared Connect tunnel as a string. Here's an example (this test should can run using Auth credentials for any sub-account of "parentAccount"):

```python
capabilities['parent-tunnel'] = "parentAccount"
```
That's it! We'll take care of the rest by making the jobs that request this capability route all their traffic through the tunnel created using your parent account (parentAccount, following our example).

##  FAQs

### What firewall rules do I need? 

Sauce Connect needs to make outbound connections to saucelabs.com and \*.miso.saucelabs.com on port 443 for the REST API and primary tunnel connections to the Sauce's cloud. It can also optionally make these connections through a web proxy; see the `--proxy`, `--pac`, and `--proxy-tunnel` command line options.

### How do I keep Sauce Connect fresh?

Sauce Connect handles a lot of traffic for heavy testers. Here is one way to keep it 'fresh' to avoid leakages and freezes.
First write a loop that will restart Sauce Connect every time it gets killed or crashes:

```bash
while :; do killall sc; sleep 30; sc -u $SAUCE_USERNAME -k $SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY; done
```
Then, write a cron task that will kill Sauce Connect on a regular basis:

```bash
crontab -e 00 00 * * * killall sc
```

This will kill Sauce Connect every day at 12am, but can be modified to behave differently depending on your requirements.  

### Can I access applications on localhost?

When using Sauce Connect, local web apps running on commonly-used ports are available to test at localhost URLs, just as if the Sauce Labs cloud were your local machine. Easy!

However, because an additional proxy is required for localhost URLs, tests may perform better when using a locally-defined domain name (which can be set in your [hosts file][6]) rather than localhost. Using a locally-defined domain name also allows access to applications on any port.

Sauce Connect proxies these commonly-used localhost ports:

80, 443, 888, 2000, 2001, 2020, 2109, 2222, 2310, 3000, 3001, 3030, 3210, 3333, 4000, 4001, 4040, 4321, 4502, 4503, 4567, 5000, 5001, 5050, 5555, 5432, 6000, 6001, 6060, 6666, 6543, 7000, 7070, 7774, 7777, 8000, 8001, 8003, 8031, 8080, 8081, 8765, 8777, 8888, 9000, 9001, 9080, 9090, 9876, 9877, 9999, 49221, 55001

Do you need a different port? [Please let us know!][4] We do our best to support ports that will be useful for many customers, such as those used by popular frameworks.

##	Troubleshooting Sauce Connect
When troubleshooting your Sauce Connect agent please make sure it has been configured to generate sc.log files by starting Sauce Connect with -vv

###	Connectivity check list
- Is there a firewall in place between the machine running Sauce Connect and Sauce Labs (saucelabs.com:443)?
- Is a proxy server required to connect to the internet, or route traffic from saucelabs.com to an internal site? If so you may need to configure Sauce Connect with the `--proxy` or `--pac` command line options.
- Sauce Connect needs to establish two outbound connections. The first is to saucelabs.com (67.23.20.87) and the second is to one of many host maikiXXXXX.miso.saucelabs.com (162.222.76.0/21).

###	Checking network connectivity to Sauce Labs
Make sure that saucelabs.com is accessible from the machine running Sauce Connect. This can be tested issuing a ping, telnet or cURL command to sacuelabs.com from the machine's command line interface. If any of these commands fail please work with your internal network team to resolve them.
```bash
 ping saucelabs.com
```
This command should return an IP address of 67.23.20.87
```bash
telnet saucelabs.com 443
```
This command should return a status message of "connected to saucelabs.com"
```bash
curl -v https://saucelabs.com/
```

###	For more help

If you need additional help, please contact help@saucelabs.com for a better response from our support team regarding Sauce Connect please provide our team with the following information.
