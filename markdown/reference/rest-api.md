}

The Sauce Labs REST API is accessed over HTTPS, with standard HTTP methods and authentication, and using [JSON][1] encoding for request and response data.

The API is versioned by URL. The current version is v1, and resides under the `saucelabs.com/rest/v1/` base URL. Some v1.1 methods have been introduced under `saucelabs.com/rest/v1.1`.

## Sauce API libraries

If you use Java, Ruby, PHP or node.js, you can use one of the below API libraries to conveniently access our API:

</ul>

## Getting Started

The Sauce Labs REST API uses [HTTP Basic Authentication][2]. The easiest way to authenticate is to include the Sauce username and access key in the request URL.

Here is an example retreiving a user's recent jobs:

```bash
curl https://sauceUsername:sauceAccessKey@saucelabs.com/rest/v1/sauceUsername/jobs
```

Note: All POST requests **must** have the `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`. All below endpoints have a base URL of `saucelabs.com/rest/v1/` and default to a `GET` request unless specified.

## Account

## Partners

This section is for use only by Sauce Labs partner accounts. If you use these commands with a standard account, they may cause unexpected behavior. To add and manage sub-accounts, head to [your sub-accounts page][5].

Create a new subaccount, specifying a Sauce Labs service plan.

```bash
curl -X POST https://sauceUsername:sauceAccessKey@saucelabs.com/rest/v1/users/sauceUsername -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"username":"subaccount-username", "password":"subaccount-password", "name":"sub-account-name", "email":"subaccount-email-address", "plan":"free"}'
```
**Available plans: ** 'free', 'small', 'team', 'com', 'complus'

Example response:

```json
{
  "access_key": "subaccount-api-key",
  "minutes": 200,
  "id": "new-subaccount-username",
  "plan": "free"
}
```
Update a subaccount Sauce Labs service plan.

```bash
curl -X POST https://sauceUsername:sauceAccessKey@saucelabs.com/rest/v1/users/sauceUsername/subscription -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"plan":"small"}'
```
Unsubscribe a subaccount from it's Sauce Labs service plan.

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://sauceUsername:sauceAccessKey@saucelabs.com/rest/v1/sauceUsername/subscription
```

## Temporary Storage

Sauce Labs provides temporary storage inside our network for mobile apps, Selenium jars, prerun executables, and other assets required by your tests. Storing assets in our network can eliminate network latency problems when sending big files to Sauce. Here's how you use our storage:

### storage/:username/:your_file_name

**Accepted Query
overwrite=true URL parameter allows files already stored in the Sauce network to be overwritten. It can be removed if you prefer to prevent overwriting.

  * Before tests start, upload the file via our REST API as described below.
  * During tests, use a special URL for the file, in the following format: `"sauce-storage:your_file_name"`
  * Sauce will find the file, download it through our fast internal network and get your tests started right away

To upload the file via our REST API:

```bash
curl -u sauceUsername:sauceAccessKey \
-X POST "http://saucelabs.com/rest/v1/storage/sauceUsername/your_file_name?overwrite=true" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" --data-binary @/path/to/your_file_name
```

This can be scripted in any programming language. Just make sure the HTTP method being used is POST and the Content-Type header is correct.

Please note that our temporary storage retains files for only 24 hours. We recommend users of this service upload files via our REST API every time their tests are about to run, as part of their build process.

## JS Unit Testing

If you already have JS unit tests, running them on Sauce using the REST API is simple.

### :username/js-tests POST

> Start your JavaScript unit tests on as many browsers as you like with a single request:

Required POST data:

`url`:  should point to the page that hosts your tests.
`framework` can be `"qunit"`, `"jasmine"`, `"YUI Test"`, `"mocha"`, or `"custom"`.

The `"custom"` framework allows you to display generic test information on the Sauce Labs website. Set `window.global_test_results` on the javascript on your unit test page to an object that looks like the following and Sauce will report any failing tests: `

Example:

```bash
    curl -X POST https://saucelabs.com/rest/v1/sauceUsername/js-tests \
        -u sauceUsername:sauceAccessKey \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data '{
            "platforms": [["Windows 7", "firefox", "27"],
                          ["Linux", "googlechrome", ""]],
            "url": "https://saucelabs.com/test_helpers/front_tests/index.html",
            "framework": "jasmine"}'
```


Response:

```json
{
      "passed": 1,
      "failed": 3,
      "total": 4,
      "duration": 4321,
      "tests": [
    {
          "name": "foo test",
          "result": false,
          "message": "sumthin bad",
          "duration": 4000
        },
    {
          "name": "bar test",
          "result": false,
          "message": "failure",
          "duration": 300
        },
    {
          "name": "baz test",
          "result": true,
          "message": "passed",
          "duration": 20
        },
    {
          "name": "qux test",
          "result": false,
          "message": "test bad",
          "duration": 1
        }
      ]
    }
```

Hosting your tests on your LAN or your laptop? You'll need to run [Sauce Connect][4] to bridge Sauce Labs to your local network. Optional parameters related to Sauce Connect include:

`tunnel_identifier` specifies the ID of a specific tunnel when using multiple Sauce Connect tunnels.
`parent_tunnel` specifies the username of a parent account whose shared Sauce Connect tunnel your tests should use.

Any other parameters get passed on as [Optional Desired Capabilities][6] for the selenium server. This means you can set things like: `max-duration`

The default `max-duration` for all JS Unit Tests is 180 seconds.

The response will look something like this:

```json
{
  "js tests": [
    "064df78366ea4b25b32f88878c9d7aa4",
    "1e5ed949711545bd952456ac37479ada"
  ]
}
```


### :username/js-tests/status

> Get the status of your JS Unit Tests

```bash
curl -X POST https://saucelabs.com/rest/v1/sauceUsername/js-tests/status \
        -u sauceUsername:sauceAccessKey \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data '{"js tests": ["064df78366ea4b25b32f88878c9d7aa4", "1e5ed949711545bd952456ac37479ada"]}'
```

Do that a few times as the tests run, waiting until the response contains `"completed": true`.

Once the tests are completed, the result will look something like this:

```json
{
  "completed": true,
  "js tests": [
    {
      "id": "064df78366ea4b25b32f88878c9d7aa4",
      "job_id": "1a7aec8ef0c64165bcde1230e213ad44",
      "platform": [
        "Windows 8",
        "internet explorer",
        "10"
      ],
      "url": "http://saucelabs.com/jobs/ff737d47e03e47bfb45100a45e4b5ca5",
      "result": {
        "durationSec": 0.005,
        "passed": true,
        "suites": [
          {
            "description": "Player",
            "durationSec": 0.005,
            "passed": true,
            "specs": [
              {
                "description": "should be able to play a Song",
                "durationSec": 0.002,
                "failedCount": 0,
                "passed": true,
                "passedCount": 2,
                "skipped": false,
                "totalCount": 2
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
You can control the job attached to the JS unit test via the `job_id`.
